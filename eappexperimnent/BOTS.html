            <h4>What is a Green Information Technology (GIT)?</h4>
            <p>An important environmental concern nowadays is the exponential increase of electronic garbage, or "e-waste," which is made up of electrical and 
                electronic equipment that has reached the end of its useful life. Electronic waste refers to several kinds of electric and electronic devices 
                that are no longer useful to their owners or fulfill their intended function. Electronic garbage, often known as e-waste, is made up of both 
                "brown goods" and "white goods," such as computers, refrigerators, washing machines, and microwaves, as well as televisions, radios, and cell 
                phones, that have reached the end of their useful lives due to redundancy, replacement, or breakdown. In addition to that, according to the
                study of Ghimire & Ariya (2020) that developing nations are producing more e-waste than industrialized ones, with China, India, Brazil, and 
                Mexico being the main producers. 66% of all e-waste created in 2019 came from the US and 14 other countries. EEA, Switzerland, Japan, US, 
                Canada, and China recycle a larger proportion of e-waste than any other country. By pushing manufacturers to create less wasteful devices, 
                establishing recycling goals, enforcing reporting requirements, and putting in place enforcement mechanisms, an efficient take-back program 
                can minimize waste while giving end-of-life management top priority in the design of new electronic products (Verma, 2020).

                <br>
                <p>E-waste recycling, which entails the methodical collection of e-waste and its processing for the recovery of precious materials, provides 
                    an invaluable instrument to reduce the growing amount of e-waste, ameliorate the scarcity of certain key resources, and bolster the economy.
                     According to Mouakket and Aboelmaged (2023) research shows that implementing green practices significantly enhances environmental performance 
                     by reducing air emissions, wastewater, solid waste, and hazardous material consumption in various contexts, including GIT. In order to address 
                     environmental concerns and achieve competitive benefits, businesses are using innovations in green production and process. Businesses can overcome
                      these obstacles and obtain a competitive edge in their supply chains with the aid of the Green Information System (Qu & Liu, 2022). In addition
                       to that, according to the study of  Nekmahmud & Fekete-Farkas, (2020) Bangladeshi consumers who believe green products are beneficial for health
                        and the environment, they see green marketing as an excellent idea for accessibility. However, their higher prices may discourage them from 
                        adopting a green lifestyle.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>By enhancing environmental knowledge and creativity for environmental performance, green human capital increases employees' confidence in 
                    their capacity to engage in environmentally friendly activities (Munawar et al., 2022). Moreover, according to Li, & Zhong (2023) Green 
                    innovation positively impacts listed agricultural companies by increasing investment in research and development, thereby enhancing 
                    enterprise performance and promoting the progress of information technology. The study offers managers in a variety of industries,
                     such as the manufacturing, process, and service sectors, insightful information about the variables impacting the adoption of </p>
